## A03 - OOP Wiki Setup  
### Kade Miller  

---

### Description:

This assignment sets up a personal OOP wiki that I’ll update as we go through class. It'll hold my definitions, catered to make sense to me (and maybe others). The goal is to build a clean, useful place to reference everything I learn in OOP.

### Files / Structure

| # | Item         | Description |
|:-:|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Wiki](https://github.com/Kamills-12/2143-OOP/wiki) | Link to the live wiki |
| 2 | Sidebar      | Index that organizes all terms |
| 3 | Wiki Pages   | Markdown pages for each concept (definitions + examples) |

---

### Notes:

- Wiki is public and inside my main repo.
- I’ll update this wiki as we cover new topics.
- Definitions are written how I understand them, not just copy/paste.
